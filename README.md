# Flappy Bird
This project was carried out as a laboratory work during my student days. It is a full copy of the famous mobile game "Flappy Bird". The project was written in a short time (1-2 days, I do not remember exactly) and does contain a lot of stupid code. But in the end it works! ðŸ˜Š

## Contribution
Not sure if anyone would want to contribute otherwise feel free to create issues, pull requests and so on. You can also email me at igabaydulin@gmail.com

## Future
It definetly needs refactoring, but maybe it also shoud be rewritten using different libs. I will do it if I have free time ãƒ½(â€¢â€¿â€¢)ãƒŽ
